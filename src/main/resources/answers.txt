1.
In the above code, the page the parameter specifies the page number (starting from 0), the size the parameter specifies the number of items per page and the sortBy the parameter specifies the property to sort by. These parameters are used to create a Pageable the object that is passed to the getAllEmployees() method in the EmployeeService class.

You can modify the default values of page, size, and sortBy as needed, and also customize the sorting behavior by modifying the Sort.by() method.

With these changes, you can now retrieve employees with pagination in your Spring Boot application using Spring Data JPA. The response will include the requested page of employees along with metadata such as the total number of pages, the total number of items, etc.

Fetch records using findAll() with Pageable: In your service or controller, inject the repository and use the findAll() method with the Pageable parameter to fetch records with pagination.
In this example, the fetchEmployeeWithPagination() method fetches users with pagination using the EmployeeRepository and the Pageable parameter. The pageNumber parameter specifies the page number (starting from 0), and the pageSize parameter specifies the number of records to fetch per page.

You can then call this method from your controller or any other part of your application to fetch 10,000 records with pagination using Spring Data JPA. Note that Spring Data JPA automatically handles the pagination and sorting logic for you, making it easy to implement pagination in your application
